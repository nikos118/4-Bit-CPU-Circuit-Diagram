# A Little About The Project
This project was created using Logic Circuit, a free software for designing and simulating digital logic circuits. This project has multiple layers of abstraction, which one can view by clicking into different sidebar tabs.

# Instructions For Use
In order to run this simulation of a CPU, first download the Logic Circuit software from https://www.logiccircuit.org/. Once downloaded, you should be able to open the file using the software. To do this launch the software, press "file" in the top left, then press "open". Now navigate to the downloaded project file and select it. In order to run the CPU, press the power icon in the bottom right corner. The project is now running! You can then input data values into the sensors and use the Tri-State buffers as you please to perform operations on inputted values. Look for labelled hints on how to use portions of the project within the project itself if you need further assistance.
